## How does ERC721A save gas?

ERC721A is a proposed standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The "A" in ERC721A stands for "atomic," indicating that it aims to reduce the number of transactions needed for certain operations, thereby potentially saving gas.

One of the main ways ERC721A saves gas is by allowing for batch transfers of tokens in a single transaction. In the original ERC721 standard, each token transfer required a separate transaction, leading to increased gas costs when transferring multiple tokens. ERC721A proposes a method for transferring multiple tokens in a single atomic transaction, thereby reducing the overall gas cost compared to individual transfers.

Additionally, ERC721A aims to optimize other operations such as token approval and token approval removal, potentially saving gas by reducing the number of transactions needed for these operations as well.

Overall, by optimizing and combining certain operations into atomic transactions, ERC721A seeks to improve the efficiency and reduce the gas costs associated with managing non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Where does it add cost?

Implementation Complexity: Implementing ERC721A requires additional logic to handle batch operations and ensure atomicity. This added complexity might require more development time and resources, which could indirectly translate into higher costs.

- Token Metadata: If ERC721A introduces changes to the token metadata structure or handling, it could potentially require more gas for token creation, querying, or metadata management.

- Contract Size: Adding additional features or optimizations might increase the size of the ERC721 contract, which could lead to higher deployment costs and potentially higher gas costs for certain operations due to increased contract size.

- Migration Costs: If existing contracts need to migrate to the ERC721A standard, there could be costs associated with updating contracts, migrating token data, and ensuring compatibility with existing systems.

- Testing and Auditing: Any changes or additions to the standard require thorough testing and auditing to ensure security and reliability. These additional steps may add costs to the development process.

Overall, while ERC721A aims to optimize gas usage for certain operations, it's essential to consider the potential trade-offs and additional costs associated with implementing and adopting the standard. Depending on the specific use case and implementation details, there may be instances where ERC721A adds some costs or complexities.
